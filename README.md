# SQL User Access & Segregation of Duties Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze user access data within an enterprise system to identify segregation of duties conflicts, inactive users with access, and other access-related risks commonly found in regulated environments.

## Objectives
- Identify users with conflicting roles (Segregation of Duties risks)
- Detect inactive or dormant users with system access
- Highlight users with elevated access risk profiles
- Demonstrate practical SQL skills applied to system and access analysis

## Project Structure
- schema.sql – Database table definitions
- sample_data.sql – Sample enterprise-style user and role data
- access_analysis.sql– SQL queries used for access risk analysis
- insights.md – Key findings and observations

## Tools Used
- SQL 
- GitHub for version control and documentation
